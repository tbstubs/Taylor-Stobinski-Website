                My philosophy as a teacher is to instill the importance of a continuous learning mindset in a positive environment, regardless of age and ability level. I believe by learning the tools and various methods of practice through playing, that any student can thrive as a musician and use these methods to achieve mastery in any application. 
            </P>
            <p class="section_information teaching_information">
                The core of my focus as a teacher is to develop individualized methods of teaching for each student. Every person has their own specific way of learning and unique personality. I believe it is my duty to learn how to teach someone as much as it is the student's duty to learn how to play. Habits of controlled tone production, rhythmic precision, accurate intonation, sensitivity, and expression are some the basic building blocks of my philosophy. 
            </P>
